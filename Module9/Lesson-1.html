	<h2>Introduction to Billy Jack:</h2>
		<p>Tom Laughlin is one of many important Indigenous activists you need to know about. He wrote, directed, and acted in four films that he resourced using his own funds. Laughlin was a veteran of the Vietnam War, and in his films, he created and played a pacifist, martial arts expert and Indigenous hero named Billy Jack. </p>

<p>The first of the four films was released in 1971 and was considered controversial because it was critical of the Vietnam War. Four unarmed students at Kent State University were shot and killed by the national guard during a peace protest. There were scenes of protesters putting flowers in the barrels of the guns of national guardsmen. It was part of the 'make love not war’ movement. And was two years ahead of a pivotal siege at Wounded Knee (1973). Billy Jack films showed Indigenous people throughout Turtle Island the hero they had been hoping for; he was cool, wise, protective, and loyal. He also represented an antidote to how Indigenous Peoples were portrayed in so many western films (as outlined in Reel Injun). His influence on Indigenous youth can hardly be overstated. He was uncompromising in his principles and when. When this film aired,  Indigenous people left the theater with pride and joy, celebrating Tom Laughlin’s Billy Jack like new found family.  But ultimately Billy Jack was a hero for everyone; he was universally loved.Bill Jack is not officially a part of this course at this time due to the licensing agreements, however if you are interested you can stream Billy Jack films  online.  It needs to be said, Tom Laughlin gave us a hero that changed everything for many Indigenous youth. A link to his fan page is below.

	 <p>Explore the importance of Indigenous reporters and Indigenous-led stories in the media. </p>
	 
	<p>In the video, it is said that Residential Schools and the harm they caused were intentional. Explore the reasoning behind the Canadian government's choice to intentionally do this. Does the Canadian government still uphold the priorities that led to their choices today? </p>
	 
	 <p>What are some subtle ways that assimilation and colonialism exist in modern contexts? </p>
	 
	<p>Make connections between genocide, residential schools, the sixties scoop, and the forced sterilization of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. </p>
	 
	 <p>How do policies and laws that exist today continue to withhold Indigenous Peoples rights?</p>
	 
		<p>Deeper Thinking: </p>
	<p>What is the significance of the graves being unmarked? What does that reflect about how the Canadian government and Catholic Church saw Indigenous Peoples and children?
